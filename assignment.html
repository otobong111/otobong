<h2>MY ACHIEVEMENT<h2>
<img src= "Brother.jpg" width="40%" align="right">
<p>My name is Otobong Emmanuel Umahaeyo, a native of Ikot Anta EnengObom in Ukanafun L.G.A Akwa Ibom State. I attended U.P.E Primary School Onne in Eleme L.G.A Rivers State where I obtained my First Leaving Certificate in 1999. In 2000 I was admitted in Goel International College Onne, Eleme L.G.A Rivers State where obtained my Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (SSCE) in 2006.<p>
<p>My first year in Goel International College was engulfed with profuse excitement because that was the beginning of me pursuing my dream to be educated, acquire knowledge and become bookish. That year I was appointed a representative of all students in my class, a position I held throughout my stays in the college. I was a member of the college dramatic club as well as one of the playwright and drama directors. My knowledge and consistency in playwright was an elevation to the standard of the college, with this, I was awarded the best student of the college.In the fifth year of my stays in the college, I was appointed the sanitary prefect of the college to oversee the environmental upkeep of the college. My tenure as the college sanitary prefect was the most efficient and functional tenure because I was making sure that every part of the college environment is sanitized and kept tidy. And more ideas were posed to make sure all the students keeps to the sanitary condition of the college. These were great achievements in my high school days.<p>
<p>After graduating from high school I obtained Jamb form in the year 2007 to further my education. The Jamb result did not meet the required points for admission, so I was not admitted. Then In 2009 I picked another Jamb form and sat for the exam, the result was good but the post utme deprived me of that year’s admission. In order to end my admission struggle after several disappointment, I now registered for the Interim Joint Matriculation Board Examination (IJMBE) in 2018 which finally ends my admission struggle. I am bold to put forward that by June 2022, I will be graduated as a Library and Information Scientist. What a profound achievement!<p>
<p>Religiously, I have headed the office of the Head of Area Children’s Fellowship in my church. Children’s Fellowship in Christian fold is one of the respected and dignified fellowship which objectives is to bring the children together and impact in them the ways of God, obedience to parents and elders at home, as well as their teachers in school. The fellowship also exposed the children to different varieties, such as debate, reading and singing competitions, talk show, playwrights and acting, presentation etc. which helps in innovation of their creativities as well as exposing their different potentials in a distinctive way for acknowledgement in preparing them for the future. Presently, I am the Assistant State choirmaster in my church right here in Kwara State.<P>
<p>In the aspect of business, I have participated in a recharge card production seminar in 2012, which I was taught on how to produce recharge cards of different denominations. At the end of the seminar I was given a Certificate of Participation. I have also participated on the production of the following items; Hair cream, Liquid soap, Air fresher, Emulsion paint, and Body lotion, in the Department of The Center For Entrepreneurship, Kwara State University, Malete.<p>
<p>In conclusion, I’m thankful to my creator, my God for giving me all these achievements, It is never by my power  but by his grace and favor. Therefore, all glory and honor belongs to him.<p>
